Share Store is an iOS application which allows users to use their iPhone camera to detect the square footage of a space they are willing to rent out (using **ARKIt**). This then determines what the space is worth based on geographical location, and notfies sends a text to the poster with this information. We used **Firebase** to store user accounts, and available storage spaces. This application was created and submitted at **QHacks 2019**.
